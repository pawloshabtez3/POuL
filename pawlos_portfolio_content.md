# About Me

I’m Pawlos Habtemariam Fisehatsion, a Full‑Stack Developer with 18 months of practical experience building modern web applications. I focus on shipping production‑ready frontends and robust backends using performant, maintainable stacks. My work emphasizes clarity, performance, and a future‑proof architecture.

I enjoy turning product ideas into polished, usable apps — from interactive UIs to scalable APIs and database integrations. I take ownership of features from design through deployment and value clean code, thoughtful UX, and repeatable engineering patterns.

Outside of building, I stay current with modern frameworks and deployment platforms to ensure the apps I deliver are fast, secure, and easy to iterate on.
